MyReads is a final project covering fundamentals of React Nanodegree.

It allows you to manipulate state of a book both on the main/front page and
on the search screen. Choosing to put a book in a selected shelf updates its
state (the shelf it's been put on) across both screens. A book that has not been
chosen yet, nor is available for reading on the front page, does not share any state.

To run the app locally type npm install, npm run and go to localhost:3000 in your browser.
